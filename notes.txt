prisma 

writes sql for us .

Prisma is a modern Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) designed mainly f
or Node.js and TypeScript environments to simplify how developers 
interact with databases. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, developers
 define a schema file describing their database models, and Prisma
  generates a type-safe query API. Prisma helps with:

  Type-safe queries: Catches errors at compile time, improving code reliability.

Auto-generated CRUD operations: Simplifies creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

Database migrations: Allows declarative schema changes to evolve the database structure safely.

Developer productivity enhancements: Clean API, rich auto-completion in editors, and a visual database browser.

NeonDB is a modern, serverless cloud database platform built specifically for PostgreSQL. It provides scalable, high-performance PostgreSQL database hosting with automatic scaling, branching, and serverless compute. NeonDB aims to give developers:

A fully managed PostgreSQL experience optimized for cloud workloads.

Features like instant branching for development/testing environments.

Serverless architecture so resources scale automatically without manual intervention.

Prisma is used within an application to write and run database queries in a type-safe, developer-friendly way,
 while NeonDB provides the PostgreSQL database backend as a managed, scalable cloud service. 
 Developers can use Prisma as the ORM client and connect it to a NeonDB PostgreSQL instance for efficient, scalable database operations.
